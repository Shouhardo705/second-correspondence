                    To Her Excellency,<br>
                    Calla of Johannesburg
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    Your letter was received by my janissary on the day preceding Halloween during the Christian calendar year of 2025. It was indeed very gratifying to hear from you so promptly, and I am indebted to you as now you have decided to respect the ancient protocols of formal correspondence. Though I must confess, you have exceeded my expectations in following them, leaving me completely awed. Moreover, I do find it interesting that your messengers have formed a suspiciously good record of arriving with correspondence the moment I step away from our irregular yet societally acceptable exchanges.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    Thank you again for your kind words and the vulnerability you have shown me. I must confess that I have held back considerably in my previous correspondence, and I do apologize for that. You always create a safe environment for me to talk about anything or raise concerns and issues I may have. Plus how easily we find resolutions to these discussions without escalation is rather admirable, and your calm and composure during these events is very praiseworthy.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    Regarding the cats, I acknowledge and stand corrected that the white cat's view is unobstructed. However, your interpretation raises a concern that I must address. Although their biases or should I say perspective, intersect at one point, extending their line of sight further reveals a critical issue as these perspectives end up diverging and move past each other in different directions. This geometric reality is deeply troubling.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    I would be committing grave disrespect if I had responded to your words of affection in any other way but the way I had. Your entire words carry enough weight that my army had to lay their weapons down and observe a moment of silence, and it was rather necessary for me to use the effects of your words. Though regarding your desire to dig a hole, I must ask: would you be kind enough to dig it large enough for two and share the coordinates? GPS precision preferred. I need to plan travel logistics accordingly. Regardless, I also have an intense longing, desire and need for you.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    Your acceptance of my decree brings me considerable satisfaction. I assure you that the place I have reserved for you remains equally guarded and permanent as the residence you've saved for me in your heart.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                    For your adherence to proper protocols and exceeding all expectations in formal correspondence, I have deemed it only fair to provide an appropriate reward that you'll find below. Happy Halloween!
                </p>
